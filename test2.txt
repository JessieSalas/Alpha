Imo this is a perfect example of the problem in being part of a group. Since humans have free will there will, always be members in that group who are malicious or nefarious and by claiming to be a part of that group you get attached to the negatives as well. That's why I don't like attaching myself to group names like conservative, liberal, gamer, Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Mormon, Muslim, communist, socialist, capitalist. I don't trust other humans because I know they have free will and some proportion p will use their free will for good and the remaining proportion (1-p) will use it for evil. So I decide to not affiliate myself with any group. Likes these gamers and the misogynists in their group. They say its about journalism ethics but they have a seemingly large number of people in their group saying hateful things about women so I am skeptical its about ethics and more about a way to verbally abuse females. Thus no cares about their ethics part and focuses on their misogyny.

She declared that "gamers are over" and that the identity of being a "gamer" was no longer valid in today's marketplace and video game culture. "Intel has pulled its advertising from website Gamasutra," Intel spokesperson Bill Calder confirmed to tech site Re/code.
