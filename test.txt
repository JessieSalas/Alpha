With my car's radio blasting "Rude" by Magic! (marry that girl, marry her anyway!), I sped past the seemingly sluggish cars on the freeway.

 

'Why the hell are they driving only 70?' I thought to myself. 'Surely they've got better things to do than waste their lives away on the freeway. I've got a bright future ahead of me that doesn't have any place on this damn freeway that, by the way, needs a lot of work.' 

 

Another car followed my path. We blazed past the other vehicles. With the comparatively small amount of traffic, I paid no attention to the road and instead flipped through the radio channels on high volume. I preoccupied myself with this task until I looked up and saw an empty distance behind me.

 

I had little time to think to myself about why this might be, and soon the inevitable happened. 

 

'weee wooo wee wooo' (my best attempt at a siren onomatopoeia... not so easy as woof or meow I'd think)

 

Well shit. Somehow I knew in the back of my mind that this would happen, with my propensity for driving 90mph. I resigned myself to fate as I started pulling over to the rightmost lane. Certainly I could afford the speeding ticket and insurance rate increase with my software job salary... I stayed there completely still with the radio still on. 

 

"Take the nearest exit off the freeway!"

 

The reader may think of me as quite the moron, and rightfully so, but at the time I was quite unaware that I was supposed to follow such procedure. I complied with the officer and found myself parked outside a golf course. My heart was pounding as the officer approached. I had two distinct thoughts as the officer approached: the first was that it really sucked that the affluent were driving by on their way to "rich people activities" and could witness my pitiful state, and the second was a faint recollection of a Reddit post that a cop made on how to get yourself out of a ticket.

 

Heck, I had nothing to lose. I followed his advice of putting my hands on 3 and 9 o'clock on the steering wheel, rolled down my window, and awaited the officer.

 

"Hey man, what's going on?"

 

"I'm really sorry, I know I was speeding... I wasn't thinking at all." I tried to act as guilty and pitiful as possible. It probably helped that I was legitimately quite panicked.

 

"Do you have any idea how fast you were driving?"

 

Pffft, 80 at the most when you started pursuing me. Of course I had been driving 90 earlier, but he had no way of knowing that.

 

"Uhh, I believe it was 80 to 90 miles per hour." I decided to give him an increased speed range to add to my guiltiness factor.

 

"That's correct. That's very unsafe," he responded with a reproaching look.

 

Well no shit sherlock... "I'm really sorry." I continued to sit there looking dejected.

 

"Why is your seat so close to the steering wheel?"

 

...What the hell? What kind of question was that? Luckily I was still in panic mode and I heard myself answering:

 

"My mom also drives this car. I completely forgot to adjust it, I'm sorry."

 

"That's very unsafe." There he goes again with the "unsafe."

 

"Should I try to adjust my seat?" I attempted to show the officer that I was compliant.

 

"Yes, go ahead and do that," he answered. And I tried to adjust my seat, sort of. The seat moved up and down and side to side, but not forward or backward. I was still trying to play the pity card and make the officer feel in as much power as possible.

 

"I dunno man, what do we do here? Today's a really busy night and we have a lot of things to do."

 

Yes! My plan was working. I sensed an opening.

 

I was still "struggling" with my seat when the officer asked me, "why did you pull over to the side of the freeway?"

 

Welp, this time it was my own stupidity rather than my cleverness that came to display. I answered honestly, "I thought I was supposed to pull over on the side of the road even on the freeway."

 

"No, that's very unsafe. You're supposed to take the first exit out of the freeway." Again with the "unsafe" reproach! This dude was starting to sound like a tape recorder! I was starting to struggle to keep up my act and responded only with an:

 

"Alright." I paused and awaited his next reproach.

 

"I dunno man, what do we do here? Today's a really busy night and we have a lot of things to do."

 

My plan was definitely working. I finally "remembered" how to move my seat back at that moment too.

 

"So man, what are the three things we learned tonight?"

 

Wooooo! I was so in the clear. "Uhh don't speed." Oh shit, what were the other two things?

 

"Right, what else?"

 

"Uhhh, move my seat back before I drive."

 

"And what's the last thing?"

 

"Uhhhhhhhh..." Oh right, I remembered, "Take the nearest exit out of the freeway when a cop turns on his siren behind me." I would realize later that I worded this terribly and called the officer a cop, but I guess he was too satisfied with having taught a stupid kid a lesson because he responded,

 

"That's right, good job!" I fist bumped the officer and he drove away.

 

And that's how I got myself out of a speeding ticket by making the officer feel good about himself and his job.

 

But I didn't come away completely unscathed; I've given up driving more than 80mph and anytime I hear a siren in real life or in a song on the radio, it scares the crap out of me while I'm driving.

Wow, I've gotten way worse at writing since starting my software job. =(

 

More specifically, I had a lot of trouble with controlling the tone of my writing and keeping the tense consistent.
